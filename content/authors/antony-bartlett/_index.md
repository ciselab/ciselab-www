I am a PhD candidate in testing AI intensive systems. My PhD will crossover and blur lines between the Multimedia Computing group and Software Engineering with both Cynthia Lien and Annibale Pannichella as my advisors.

As a non standard academic career I have worked the last 15 years in industry working on projects such as IBM Watson at IBM. I hope to bring a different perspective to the team and drive our research forward to new heights.

Outside of study I'm an avid climber and videogamer so feel free to search me out in the MMC group if you want talk games.
