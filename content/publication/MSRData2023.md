summary = "We present HasBugs, a manually collected Dataset of 25 Haskell Bugs from 6 Open Source Repositories. We provide buggy, tested and fixed versions as well as reproduction packages and a summary of the bug and its context. For technical users,the dataset is meant to either help researchers adopt techniques from other Languages for Haskell or to provide a human-verified gold standard for tool-evaluation. We also see applicability for qualitative research, e.g. by analysis of bug-lifecycles and comparison to other languages. We provide a companion website for easy access and overview under https://ciselab.github.io/HasBugs/"
