title: "Serverless Testing: Tool Vendors' and Experts' Point of View"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Serverless architecture is an emerging design style for cloud-based software systems. Testing serverless applications plays an important role in software quality assurance. However, currently, there is no consensus on how to test and debug such systems properly. Moreover, the current lack of mature tooling is a central challenge. We designed and conducted three interviews among two tools vendor leaders in the serverless domain (Epsagon and Thundra) and one expert in the field (Yan Cui), investigating the good and bad practices and several open issues. The current status of testing and debugging in serverless-based applications depicted by the experts helped us to highlight issues and challenges that need to be deeply investigated."
